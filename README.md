# NBA-point-spread-bet

I am creating a model to calculate probability an NBA team beats the spread for any regular season matchup.

### Motivation
Basketball is my favorite sport to watch, specifically the NBA. I thought it would be a fun endeavor to try to predict a team's performance against the spread in a given matchup. If successful I forsee the proportion of future lunch bets I win to drastically increase!!
